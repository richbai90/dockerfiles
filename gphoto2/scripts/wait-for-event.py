# gp.camera_wait_for_event() function waits for
# a capture trigger to arrive. When it does, it downloads
# the image directly from the camera, without using SD
# card
#
# gp_camera_trigger_capture() or Trigger Button on the
# camera can be used to start capturing.
#
# gp_capture_image_and_download() method takes about 2 seconds
# to process since it saves the image to SD CARD
# first then downloads it, which takes a lot of time.
